# cntrs

A simple data-structure to count elements from an iterable.
Essentially, it's just a `Map` with an incrementer and a default return.

Lots of this is based on <https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-stats>.
I wanted to be able to initialise the hashmap with different capacities and 
to add some more features, documentation, and tests.
